# SSH_Brute_Force

***Disclaimer*** 
Always have permission from the owner to brute force an ssh login

If you need a wordlist to utilize, you may get similar lists at: https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials

It should be noted that the default Kali SSH settings will prohibit authentication attempts after ten tries. To test 100 connections + the valid password using the preceding wordlist, update your sshd_config and restart the service. To test, use a wordlist with fewer than ten incorrect passwords.
